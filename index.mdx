Peepal is an AI-powered people verification API that validates claims about individuals using public web evidence. You send a person seed and a set of claims, then Peepal returns a scored report with sources and explanations.

## How verification works

1. Create a job with a person seed and claims.
2. Peepal gathers sources and evaluates each claim.
3. Fetch the report or listen for webhook events.

## What you can verify

- Education (schools, degrees, fields, dates)
- Employment (employers, titles, dates)
- Business ownership (company, role, domain)
- Identity signals (email, LinkedIn, GitHub, websites)

## Use the dashboard

Use the dashboard to create projects, manage API keys, and configure webhooks. API requests are scoped to the project tied to your API key so you can keep environments and teams separate.
