All `/v1/*` endpoints require an API key. `/v1/health` is public.

## Use an API key

Send your API key in the `x-api-key` header.

```bash
curl -s "$BASE_URL/v1/jobs" \
  -H "x-api-key: $API_KEY"
```

API keys are managed in the dashboard. Each key is scoped to a single project, and the API uses that scope to select data. Keep keys secure and rotate them if they are exposed.

## Session authentication

Session cookies are used by the dashboard UI, but the public API still requires `x-api-key` for all `/v1/*` endpoints.

## Rate limits

API keys are rate limited to 100 requests per minute. If you need higher limits, contact support.

## Request IDs

Every response includes a `Request-Id` header. Use it when contacting support or when tracing errors.
