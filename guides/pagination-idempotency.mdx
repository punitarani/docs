## Pagination

List endpoints use cursor-based pagination with `limit` and `cursor` query parameters.

### Prerequisites

- An API key scoped to your project
- A list endpoint to query

### Example

```bash
curl -s "$BASE_URL/v1/jobs?limit=25" \
  -H "x-api-key: $API_KEY"
```

The response includes `next_cursor`. Pass that value in the next request to continue.

```bash
curl -s "$BASE_URL/v1/jobs?limit=25&cursor=2024-06-01T12:00:00Z" \
  -H "x-api-key: $API_KEY"
```

## Idempotency

Use the `Idempotency-Key` header when creating jobs to avoid duplicates on retries. Keys are stored for 24 hours.

```bash
curl -X POST "$BASE_URL/v1/jobs" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: $API_KEY" \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: job_ada_001" \
  -d '{
    "person": { "full_name": "Ada Lovelace" },
    "claims": [
      {
        "claim_key": "edu_1",
        "claim_type": "education",
        "expected": { "school": "University of London" }
      }
    ]
  }'
```
