description: "Endpoints, schemas, and authentication for the Peepal API."
---

The Peepal API is organized around projects. All protected endpoints are under `/v1`, and your API key determines the project scope, so you do not include a project ID in the path.

## Base URL

Use your Peepal API base URL when calling endpoints.

```text
https://api.peepal.dev
```

## Authentication

Authenticate with an API key using the `x-api-key` header.

## Idempotency

Use `Idempotency-Key` with job creation requests to safely retry.

## Errors

Errors follow RFC 7807 Problem Details. See the [Errors](/guides/errors) guide for details.
