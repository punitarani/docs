description: "Understand report structure, scores, and evidence."

A report summarizes the verification outcome for a completed job. It includes a score, per-claim results, identity resolution, and evidence sources.

## Score overview

Scores range from 0 to 100. Peepal weights each claim category as follows:

- Identity: 0.3
- Employment: 0.4
- Education: 0.2
- Business: 0.1

Scores are adjusted by claim confidence and weights.

## Identity resolution

Identity resolution determines whether the person seed matches available public profiles.

- `matched`
- `ambiguous`
- `no_match`
