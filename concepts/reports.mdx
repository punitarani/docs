description: "Understand report structure, scores, and evidence."

A report summarizes the verification outcome for a completed job. It includes a score, per-claim results, identity resolution, and evidence sources.

## Score overview

Scores range from 1 to 5 (integer). Peepal weights each claim category as follows:

- Identity: 0.3
- Employment: 0.4
- Education: 0.2
- Business: 0.1

Scores are adjusted by claim confidence (1-5), claim status, and weights.

## Identity resolution

Identity resolution determines whether the person seed matches available public profiles.

- `status`: `matched`, `ambiguous`, `no_match`
- `confidence`: 1-5 confidence for the legacy status
- `identity_status` (optional): `confirmed`, `high_confidence`, `likely`, `possible`, `no_match`
- `identity_confidence` (optional): 1-5 confidence for identity status
- `profiles` (optional): discovered profiles with type and primary flag
