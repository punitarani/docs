A job represents one verification run. It includes a person seed, a set of claims, and optional configuration. Jobs run asynchronously and move through a defined lifecycle.

## Job lifecycle

- `queued`: Accepted and waiting to start
- `running`: Evidence collection and claim evaluation in progress
- `completed`: Report is available
- `failed`: Job ended with an error
- `canceled`: Job was canceled before completion

Use the `progress` field (0-100) to show status updates in your UI.

## Job payload

A job response includes the person seed, claims, and optional links to related resources.

  },
  "claims": [
    {
      "claim_key": "edu_1",
      "claim_type": "education",
      "expected": { "school": "University of London" }
    }
  ],
  "options": {
    "depth": "standard",
    "max_sources": 30
  },
  "links": {
    "self": "/v1/jobs/job_01HXYZ",
    "report": "/v1/jobs/job_01HXYZ/report",
    "sources": "/v1/jobs/job_01HXYZ/sources"
  }
}
```

## Canceling jobs

You can cancel jobs while they are `queued` or `running`. Canceling a completed or failed job returns a conflict error.
