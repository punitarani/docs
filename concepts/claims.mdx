Claims tell Peepal what to verify about a person. Each claim has a unique `claim_key`, a `claim_type`, and an `expected` payload that matches the type.

## Claim types

- `education`: school, degree, field, start and end years
- `employment`: employer, title, start and end dates
- `business`: business name, domain, role
- `identity`: email, domains, profile URLs

## Basic claim example

```json
{
  "claim_key": "edu_1",
  "claim_type": "education",
  "expected": {
    "school": "University of London",
    "degree": "Mathematics",
    "field": "Mathematics",
    "start_year": 1830,
    "end_year": 1835
  }
}
```

## Advanced claim matching

Use `match_rules` and `weight` to tune matching behavior and scoring.

```json
{
  "claim_key": "id_1",
  "claim_type": "identity",
  "expected": {
    "email_domain": "example.com",
    "github_url": "https://github.com/ada"
  },
  "match_rules": {
    "match_strength": "semantic",
    "min_confidence": 0.7
  },
  "weight": 2.5
}
```

## Claim results

Each claim result includes a status and confidence score (1-5, where 5 is highest).

- `verified`
- `not_verified`
- `inconclusive`
- `contradiction`
