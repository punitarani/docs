Projects scope your data and API access. Every API request is scoped by the API key's project, so you can separate production, staging, and customer environments.

## Create a project

Use the dashboard to create a project and generate an API key for it. The API key determines the project context for all `/v1` requests, so you do not include a project ID in the URL.

## Manage API keys

API keys are created per project in the dashboard. Use a different key for each environment and rotate keys regularly.

## Webhook configuration

You can configure webhook endpoints per project in the dashboard or via the API. Each endpoint can subscribe to specific job events.
